You can create a multitiered enterprise hierarchy by nesting account groups within an account group. If you need to, you can reorganize by moving accounts between account groups.\n\nFor example, the following diagram depicts a four-tier enterprise that you can set up by nesting account groups. First, you create two account groups that have the enterprise as the parent. Then, you can create two additional account groups that have one of those account groups as a parent. You can move accounts freely within the account groups, no matter what tier they're in. However, account groups cannot be moved.\n\n![IBM Cloud Enterprise Account Model](images/sampleea.png)\n\n## **Enterprise Management**\n - Create and manage enterprises, account groups, and accounts. \n - An enterprise is a hierarchical account structure that you can use to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple IBM Cloud accounts.\n - In an enterprise, you can import existing accounts from outside the enterprise or create new accounts within the enterprise, and then organize the accounts by using account groups.\n - To create a multitiered hierarchy, you can nest account groups within an account group\n\n## **Creating Sub-account (Account Groups)**\n\nTo create an account group, you need the Administrator or Editor role on the Enterprise service in the enterprise account.\n\n - From the Enterprise dashboard in the IBM Cloud console, click Accounts to view the accounts and account groups in the enterprise.\n\nIn the Account groups section, click Create.\n\n - Enter a name for the account group that reflects the accounts that it will contain.\n\n - If you want an enterprise user other than yourself to be the primary contact for the account group, select their IBMid from the Contact menu. \n\n - The contact is different from an account owner in that they don't have any additional access within the account group or its accounts. The user that you select as a contact acts as a focal point for any account group issues. \n - If you want the account group to be in a different part of your enterprise hierarchy, select a different parent.\n\n - Account groups can't be deleted or moved from where you create them.\n        \n - Click Create.\n\n![IBM Cloud Enterprise Account Model](images/subaccount.png)\n\n## **Resources**\n - [Accounts in Enterprise Account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize)","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d4cf9acd15f949a7a083d160a891e603","counter":782,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sub Accounts"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Sub Accounts\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nUse account groups to organize related accounts in your IBM Cloud® enterprise.
