The accounts and account groups that you can view usage for depends on your assigned access.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises enable you to centrally manage multiple IBM Cloud accounts. As an enterprise user, you can keep an eye on resource usage and the associated costs for any account in the enterprise.\n\n## Retrieve Enterprise usage by API\n\nThe Enterprise Usage Reports API (Beta) provides access to the usage reports for entities that are managed by an IBM Cloud™ enterprise. Usage reports are provided for three types of entities: \n  - An enterprise, an account group, and an account. \n  - You can query for usage reports for an entity or its immediate children in the enterprise hierarchy. \n\n  *Note:* When you call the API, replace the ID variables and IAM token with the values from your enterprise.\n\n  **View usage for the entire enterprise for the current month**\n\n  ```\n    curl -X GET \\\n    \"https://enterprise.test.cloud.ibm.com/v1/resource-usage-reports?enterprise_id=$ENTERPRISE_ID\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer <IAM_Token>\" \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n  ```\n\n  **View usage for an account group for July 2019**\n\n  ```\n  curl -X GET \\\n  \"https://enterprise.test.cloud.ibm.com/v1/resource-usage-reports?account_group_id=$ACCOUNT_GROUP_ID&month=2019-07\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer <IAM_Token>\" \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n  ```\n\n  **View usage for account groups and accounts directly under the enterprise**\n\n  ```\n  curl -X GET \\\n  \"https://enterprise.test.cloud.ibm.com/v1/resource-usage-reports?enterprise_id=$ENTERPRISE_ID&children=true\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer <IAM_Token>\" \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n  ```\n\n  **View usage for an account group with page size**\n  \n  ```\n  curl -X GET 'https://enterprise.cloud.ibm.com/v1/resource-usage-reports?account_group_id=$ACCCOUNT_GROUP_ID&month=2019-07&children=true&limit=2' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <IAM Token>'\n  ```\n\n  **View usage for an account**\n  ```\n  curl -X GET 'https://enterprise.cloud.ibm.com/v1/resource-usage-reports?account_id=$ACCOUNT_ID&month=2019-07&children=true' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <IAM Token>'\n  ```\n\n  \n\n## Retrieve Enterprise usage by CLI\n  - IBM Cloud CLI provides the command line interface for managing resources in IBM Cloud.
