With IBM Cloud Transit Gateway, organizations can define and control communication between resources on the IBM Cloud network, providing dynamic scalability, high availability, and private, in-transit data between IBM Cloud data centers. Transit gateways are commonly implemented to support hybrid workloads, frequent data transfers, private workloads, or to ease administration of the IBM Cloud environment. One can configure several types of connections with IBM Cloud Transit Gateway:\n\n    1. Connect VPCs in the same region (local routing)\n    2. Connect VPCs in different regions (global routing)\n    3. Connect VPCs to your IBM Cloud classic infrastructure\n\n![keymanagement with openshift-1](images/Screenshot_12.jpg)\n\nWe will be leveraging the capability of VPC Interconnect across regions to connect DC and DR through transit gateway.\n\nFrom cost perspective Transit Gateway is charged above 1TB data transfer monthly.
