With IBM Cloud Transit Gateway, organizations can define and control communication between resources on the IBM Cloud network, providing dynamic scalability, high availability, and private, in-transit data between IBM Cloud data centers. Transit gateways are commonly implemented to support hybrid workloads, frequent data transfers, private workloads, or to ease administration of the IBM Cloud environment. One can configure several types of connections with IBM Cloud Transit Gateway:\n\n    1. Connect VPCs in the same region (local routing)\n    2. Connect VPCs in different regions (global routing)\n    3. Connect VPCs to your IBM Cloud classic infrastructure\n\n![keymanagement with openshift-1](images/Screenshot_2.jpg)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a494bd392ede5eba534591c6be4ff9bc","counter":943,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sharing Block Storage Volumes across Cross Region VPC"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Sharing Block Storage Volumes across Cross Region VPC\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Introduction\nThis article show cases cross VPC sharing of volumes which might be useful in DR kind of scenarios\n\n\n## Architecture\nThe solution has DC and DR located in two regions Dallas and Washington DC within Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) that are connected to each other through a transit gateway.
