It will forward your request to CIS\n- Wait for 1 hour to process and you will see the \"Added Domain\" become active with Green Icon\n\n### (3) Create the Certificate Manager\n\n- Launch the Catalog and search for Certificate Manager\n- Select the location where you want service to be provisioned\n- Provide the Service name and select the resource group where you want service to be organized in the account\n- Click Create\n\n\n### (4) Order the Certificates for domain\n\n- Open the CM from the IBM Cloud Dashboard\n- Click Order. As part of the ordering process, Certificate Manager validates that you own the domains that are listed in your certificate order by interacting with your DNS provider.\n- Click IBM CIS and continue\n- Select the Domain which you added to CIS in the previous steps\n- Checkbox the Add Domain , Add WildCard from the Certificate Domain\n- Select the Common name as \"*.openfn.co\" so it applies to all subdomain within domain\n- Click Order\n\n![CM Overview](./images/CM.png)\n\n### (5) Configure DNS for endpoint\n\n- Click Reliability and select DNS\n- Configure the DNS Records. Manage your DNS records and control whether to proxy traffic through Cloud Internet Services. Proxied traffic can leverage WAF, DDoS, and Caching capabilities.\n- Add DNS Records by Select \"CNAME\" from type, \"subdomain-name\" for \"Name\" and \"application endpoint\" for the \"IPV4 address\"\n- Click Add\n- You repeat above process for the number of DNS Records which you want for your application\n\n![CIS DNS Records](./images/DNSRecord.png)\n\n### (6) Configure Page Rules \n\n- Customize your Cloud Internet Services configuration on a page-by-page basis. Using specific domain paths you can enable, disable, or modify the behavior of CIS functions to optimize your application.\n- Click Create Rule\n- Provide the URL Match like \"ldap.openfn.co\"\n- Provide the Host Override Value with the \"application endpoint\" \n- Click Create\n- You repeat above process for the number of PageRules based on the DNS Records which you created.\n\n![CIS Pagerule](./images/Pagerule.png)\n\nYou are successfully created the Cloud internet services, certificate manager and added domain.\n\n![CIS Overview](./images/Overview.png)\n\n\n## Resources\n- [Cloud Internet Services Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started)\n- [Certificate Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/certificate-manager?topic=certificate-manager-getting-started)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d953ef22ab3caf034da4a3240f4e75d1","counter":928,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cloud Internet Services"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Cloud Internet Services \n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Overview\n\nIBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS), powered by Cloudflare, provides a fast, highly performant, reliable, and secure internet service for customers running their business on IBM Cloud.\n\nIBM CIS gets you started quickly by establishing defaults for you, which you can change easily using the UI or API.\n\n![IBM Cloud Internet Services](images/CIS.png)\n\n## Process Overview\n\nYou can start using CIS for your internet traffic with just a few steps.\n\n- Create the CIS from your IBM Cloud Catalog.\n- Add the domain that you want to manage.\n- Configure your DNS information with the name servers provided.\n- Create the Certificate Manager (CM)\n- Order the SSL Certificates via IBM Certificate Manager\n- Configure DNS Records and Page rule to route traffic.\n\n### (1) Create the Cloud Internet Services\n\n- Launch the Catalog and search for Cloud Internet Services\n- Select the Enterprise Usage plan\n- Provide the service name \"openfn-cis\" and select the resource group where you want to be organized in the account\n- Click Create\n\n### (2) Add Domain in Cloud Internet Services\n\n- Open the CIS Service from the IBM Cloud Dashboard\n- Select Overview and Click \"+\" next to the domain section on right hand side\n- Provide the domain name, DNS Records in the \"Setup your domain section\"\n- Update the 2 nameservers what CIS provided in the \"Domain Purchase Site\" where you bought domain.
