This script creates a Schematics workspace that then executes Terraform scripts to create the necessary resources.\n\nCurrently you can run the script to install:\n\n- Cloud Pak for Multi Cloud Management\n- Cloud Pak for Application\n- Cloud Pak for Data\n- Cloud Pak for Integration (under development)\n\n## **Install with IBM Cloud Shell**\n\n[Understanding the IBM Cloud User Interface](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui)\n\n### Get Registry Key\n\nEach Cloud Pak requires an entitlement key. The script will prompt for this key and the email associated with it to install any of the Cloud Paks.\n\nIf you do not have the key visit this link to generate one:\n[Generate Cloud Pak Entitlement Key](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary)\n\nNOTE: For Cloud Pak for Data you will also need your docker credentials if installing the Guardium External Strap module\n\n### Download the Script\n\nLog in to your [IBM Cloud](http://cloud.ibm.com) account and click the terminal icon in the upper right corner of IBM Cloud console to open the **IBM Cloud Shell** \n\n![bash-button](./images/bash-symbol.png)\nWithin the **IBM Cloud Shell** terminal, ensure you are in the correct account\n\n     ibmcloud target\n     \nClone the following repo:\n \n     git clone https://github.com/ibm-hcbt/cloud-pak-sandboxes\n\n### Run Installer\n\nTo run the installer, do the following in the **IBM Cloud Shell** terminal:\n\n    cd cloud-pak-sandboxes/installer\n    chmod +x create-schematic.sh\n    ./create-schematic.sh\n\nFrom here the Installer will ask you a set of questions pertaining to the cluster you wish to create. \n\nHere is a sample of CP4MCM output:\n\n![script-sample](./images/sample-script.png)\n\n### Checking your Workspace\n\nTo check your workspace:\n\n#### 1. Log in to your [IBM Cloud](http://cloud.ibm.com) account\n#### 2. Select \"Schematics workspaces\" from the resource menu on top left column of IBM Cloud Console\n\nThe image below shows the button for the resource list (orange box), as well as the two menu locations to find the cluster (green box) when the workspace finishes, and the workspace (red box) which you can follow while the script runs. \n\nNOTE: You will need permissions to view workspace schematics.\n\n![resource-list](./images/resource-list.png)\n\n#### 3. Click to open your workspace\nAll workspaces and clusters made with this tool will end in \"-sandbox\"\n\nThe workspace will look like this. The \"activity\" button and the \"workspaceid\" are marked. You can also view the variables entered when using the script:\n![sample1](./images/activity-location.png)\n\nWithin the **Schematic workspace** select **Activity** from left menu. Select **View log** link from **Plan applied** row, as shown in the image below:\n\n![sample2](./images/activity-log.png)\n**NOTE:** the workspace activity plan logs will print out the Cloud Pak console *url*, *username* and *password* once the installation is complete.\n\n## **Install with Personal Device (for advanced users)**\n\nTo run this Installer on your local machine:\n\n1. Ensure that [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) is installed\n   \n2. Ensure that the [IBM Schematics Plug-in](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli) is installed\n   \n   `ibmcloud plugin install schematics`\n3. Log into the ibm cloud \n   \n   `ibmcloud login -sso`\n4. Ensure that you are in the desired account and resource group \n   \n   `ibmcloud target`\n\n5.
