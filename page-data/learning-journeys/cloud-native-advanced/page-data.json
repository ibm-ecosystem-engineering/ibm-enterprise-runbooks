Developer intermediate focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Developer advanced focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*.\n\nThese learning tasks are more advanced than those from the developer intermediate experience, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Over the Web\">\n\n## Before the Workshop\n\nPlease complete these tasks before attending the first session. This will help you get started quickly with the practical exercises.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Welcome Message | Welcome to Cloud-Native Workshop  | [Introduction](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/getting-started/introduction) | 5 mins |\n| Prerequisites | Install the prerequisite tools  | [Setup Prerequisites](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/getting-started/prereqs) | 10 mins |\n| Sandbox Access | Validate access to your Development Cluster |  [Validate](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/getting-started/checksetup) | 10 min |\n| **Continous Delivery** | | | |\n| Continous Delivery (CD) | Overview | [CD](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-intermediate/continuous-delivery) | 15 mins |\n| CD Implementation | Application Delivery with Gitops | [Gitops](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/gitops) | 15 mins |\n| **Database Integration** | | | |\n| Cloudant | Integrate Backend with Cloudant Database | [Cloudant](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-cloudant) | 15 mins |\n| MongoDB | Integrate Backend with MongoDB Database | [MongoDB](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-mongodb) | 15 mins |\n| Postgres | Integrate Backend with Postgres Database | [Postgres](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-postgres) | 15 mins |\n| **Authentication** | | | |\n| App ID | Secure the solution with App ID  | [App ID](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-appid/) | 15 mins |\n| **API Consumption** | | | |\n| API | Consume API from client applications  | [API Consumption](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-api/) | 15 mins |\n| Mobile App | Mobile App consuming API's  | [Mobile App](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-mobile-app/) | 15 mins |\n| **Advanced Monitoring and Logging** | | | |\n| Monitoring | Advanced Monitoring with Sysdig | [Advanced Monitoring](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/monitoring/) | 30 mins |\n| Log Management | Advanced Log Management with LogDNA | [Advanced Log Management](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/log-management/) | 30 mins |\n| **DevSecOps** | | | |\n| DevSecOps | DevSecOps Overview | [DevSecOps](developer-advanced/devsecops) | 15 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Aqua CSP | [Container Security](developer-advanced/devsecops-aquasec-csp) | 20 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Twistlock | [Container Security](developer-advanced/devsecops-twistlock) | 20 mins |\n| Add security to CI/CD | DevSecOps with Trivy | [Incorporate CI/CD](developer-advanced/devsecops-trivy) | 30 mins |\n| **Operators** | | | |\n| Operator Overview | Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application |[Operator](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/operator/) | 15 min |\n| Operator Labs | Developing operator step by step |[Operator Labs](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/operator/lab) | 45 min |\n| **Advanced Application Modernization** | | | |\n| Collect Data from Legacy App | | | |\n| Analyze with TA | | | |\n| Modernize the app | | | |\n| **Advanced Microservices Techniques** | | | |\n| Servimesh & KNative | | | |\n| Modify inventory application with service mesh | | | |\n| Kiali, jaeger | | | |\n| Events with Kafka | | | |\n| Contract testing | | | |\n| OpenAPI and Swagger Editor | | | |\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Self Paced\">\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"In Person\">\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\nOnce you have completed these tasks, you will have completed the learning requirements for both the intermediate and the advanced Experience.
