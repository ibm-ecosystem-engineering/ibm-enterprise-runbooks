It is designed to help you navigate to the installed tools and give you a simple way to perform common developer tasks, such as:\n- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster\n- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud\n- **<Globals name=\"templates\" />**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project\n\nWith the release of **<Globals name=\"ocp\" />** it is now even easier for\n developers to integrate the SDLC tools into the OpenShift console. This\n  console is mainly focused on providing a simple navigation experience when\n   the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> is installed into <Globals name=\"iks\" />.\n\n![Developer Dashboard](/images/developer-dashboard.png)\n\nHere are some recent improvements:\n- More tools can be added to the dashboard using a simple `igc tool-config\n` command\n- Prefix and Title can be customised to you own names\n- The IBM Cloud link can be overidden to support links to multi cloud vendors\n when OpenShift is running on Azure, AWS or Google Cloud and VMWare\n- The tools view is split into two 4 columns to enable more reuse of the screen\n- The Cluster information is now available when you click on `Developer\n Dashboard` title\n- The <Globals name=\"igccli\" /> now installs an alias into the `oc` and\n `kubectl` so it is now possible to open the dashboard quickly using `oc\n  dashboard` and `kubectl dashboard`\n \n### Tools configured with OpenShift Console\n\nWhen the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> was configured for your development\n cluster. The administrator can now configure a set of short cut links to\n  common tools you often use as a developer. \n  \n![OpenShift Links](/images/openshift-console-tools.png)\n\nYou can see how these tools are confgured by reading the [Tools configuration\n](/admin/config-install)\n \n \n### Opening the Dashboard\n\n- Open a terminal\n- Make sure you are logged into your Development cluster in a terminal.\n- To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud Console_, click on the **Access** tab and\nfollow the instructions to login from the command line\n\n- You can open the Dashboard from the enviornment you are configured with, use the [IGC CLI](/guides/cli#dashboard).\n    ```\n    oc dashboard | kubectl dashboard | igc dashboard\n    ```\n  \n- This will open the Dashboard\n\n### Access the tools URLs\n\n- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:\n    ```bash\n    oc endpoints -n tools | kubectl endpoints | igc endpoints\n    ```\n\n- This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster.\n    ```bash\n   ?

You can use these credentials to log into each of the installed tools.\n- More of the tools in <Globals name=\"ocp\" /> will be integrated into the\n OpenShift console login process \n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nIf you are using OpenShift, the Jenkins credential\nwill be `undefined` because the OpenShift built in Jenkins service uses IBM cloud single sign-on mechanism.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Customizing the Tools view\n\nThe tools dashboard supports a collection of tools links. These links can be\n added to the <Globals name=\"env\" /> using the `igc` command line. This\n  enables a level of customization for the development. You can use this to\n   link out to your Cloud Pak main dashboards, or you can add a reference to\n    your Github project. \n    \n- To add a tool follow the syntax below.  \n    ```bash\n    igc tool-config --name <name of tool> --url <url of tool> \n    ```\n\nThe following is a list of supported tools that be configured for displayed.\n \n| Tool Name                | Name Parameter  | Description | Pre-Configured |\n| -----------------------  |:-------------- |:------------| :----------- |\n| GitLab | `gitlab`  | IBM Cloud GitLab instance for the region you are using | Yes |\n| Eclipse Che | `che` | Link to Eclipse Che instance | No |  \n| Jenkins | `jenkins` | If IKS configured by default | Yes |\n| Pipeline | `pipeline` | If OCP configured by default | Yes |\n| ArgoCD | `argocd` | Link to ArgoCD instance in cluster | Yes |\n| Artifactory | `artifactory` | Link to Artifactory instance in cluster | Yes |\n| SonarQube | `sonarqube` | Link to SonarQube instance in cluster | Yes |\n| Pact | `pact` | Link to Pact Broker instance in cluster | Yes |\n| Tekton | `tekton` | Link to Tekton Dashboard in cluster | No |\n| Transformation Advisor | `ta` | Link to Transformation Advisor tool in cluster | No |\n| Swagger Editor | `apieditor` | Link to Swagger Editor instance in cluster | Yes |\n| CodeReady Workspaces | `codeready` | Link to CodeReady Workspaces instance in cluster | No |\n| GitHub | `github` | Link to teams GitHub organization | Yes |\n| Cloud Pak for Integration | `integration` | Link to main console for Cloud Pak for Integration | No |\n| Cloud Pak for Multi Cloud Manager | `mcm` | Link to main console for Cloud Pak for Multi Cloud Manager | No |\n| Cloud Pak for Data | `data` | Link to main console for Cloud Pak for Data | No |\n| Cloud Pak for Automation | `automation` | Link to main console for Cloud Pak for Automation | No |\n| Grafana | `grafana` | Link to Grafana in cluster | No |\n| Prometheus | `prometheus` | Link to Prometheus in cluster | No |\n| LogDNA | `logDNA` | Link to LogDNA service instance | No |\n| Sysdig | `Sysdig` | Link to Sysdig service instance | No |\n| Image Registry | `ir` | Link to Image Registry | No |\n| Jaeger| `jaeger` | Link to Jaeger in cluster | Yes |\n\n\n### Customizing the Dashboard\n\nAfter the Dashboard has been installed into you development cluster. You can\n customized some of the paramters that enable you to make it tailored to you\n  teams needs. You can change the Title , Prefix, and Cloud Console links by\n   adding the following Environment variables to you deployment yaml.\n   \n   You can also tailor the list of content that is displayed in the\n    Activitation tab and the Code Patterns tab by creating your own version\n     of the [`links.json`](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/developer-dashboard/blob/master/public/data/links.json) JSON file and host that somewhere accessible to you\n      clusters network.\n      \n- Add the following environment variables to the Dashboard instances in the\n `tool` namespace.\n    ```\n    env:\n        - name: DASHBOARD_TITLE\n          value: GSI Labs Sandbox\n        - name: DASHBOARD_PREFIX\n          value: IBM \n        - name CLOUD_TITLE\n          value: Azure Console\n        - name: CLOUD_URL\n          value: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/\n        - name: LINKS_URL\n          value: http://<url>/data/links.json\n    ```\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0c3b193e6c02f2fdcd77b55a54143340","counter":289,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Developer Dashboard"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Developer Dashboard\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThe <Globals name=\"env\" /> includes the Developer Dashboard\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nThe Developer Dashboard is one of the tools running in your <Globals name=\"env\" />.
