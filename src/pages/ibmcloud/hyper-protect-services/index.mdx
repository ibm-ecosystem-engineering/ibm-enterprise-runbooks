## **Overview**

IBM Cloud® Hyper Protect Crypto Services (Hyper Protect Crypto Services for short) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM)
based on IBM Cloud. With this service, you can take the ownership of the cloud HSM to fully manage your encryption keys and to perform cryptographic operations. Hyper Protect Crypto Services is also the only service in the cloud industry that is built on FIPS 140-2 Level 4-certified hardware


## **Hyper Protect Crypto Services**

Hyper Protect Crypto Services integrates with Key Protect application programming interface (API) to generate and manage keys. The Keep Your Own Key (KYOK) function is also enabled to provide access to cloud-based cryptographic HSMs. You can access the network addressable HSMs by making standard PKCS #11 API calls or Enterprise PKCS #11 over gRPC (GREP11) API calls to perform cryptographic operations.

You can provision Hyper protect Crypto Services using IBM cloud catelog or using terraform script mentioned below:
[Terraform module to provision Hyper protect Crypto service](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/terraform-ibm-hpcs)

## **Post install steps**

Once a Hyper Protect Crypto Service has been provisioned, it must be initialized before it can be used. Currently, the initialization process must be performed manually. The following steps must be followed to complete the initialization 

## Key Ceremony

![Key Ceremony](images/Key-Initialization.png)

## Here are the steps to initialize(Key ceremony) of HPCS

## Install TKE CLI plun-in
### ibmcloud plugin install tke

Set the environment variable CLOUDTKEFILES on your workstation to specify the directory where you want to save the master key part files and signature key files. The signature keys are used to sign TKE administrative commands.

On the Linux® operating system or MacOS, add the following line to the .bash_profile file:

### export CLOUDTKEFILES=[local-directory]

## To display the service instances and crypto units in the target resource group under the current user account, use the following command:

## **Hyper Protect DBaaS**

IBM Cloud® Hyper Protect DBaaS provides tamper-proof, enterprise cloud database environments with high availability for workloads with sensitive data. It offers a flexible platform that allows you to easily provision and manage your database of choice (MongoDB and PostgreSQL), without data security concerns.
Built on IBM LinuxONE technology, Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB helps you to alleviate data security and compliance concerns with built-in encryption and tamper protection for data at rest and in flight. You can deploy your workloads with sensitive data and build compliant applications without having to be a security expert.
Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB provides a reliable environment that allows you to become more agile in application development. You can quickly get started and move your mission-critical data to the highly available and managed database clusters, saving time and costs on operations. You can also flexibly adjust the amount of resources to meet your requirements.

You can provision Hyper protect DBaaS for MongoDB using IBM cloud catelog or using terraform script mentioned below:
[Terraform module to provision Hyper protect DBaaS for MongoDB](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/terraform-ibm-hpdbaas-mongodb)

![Hyper protect DBAAS service instance](images/Hyper-protect-DBAAS-service-instance.png)

## Hyper protect DBAAS service integration with Hyper protect crypto service

## **Hyper Protect Virtual Servers**

IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers grant you complete authority over your Linux-based virtual servers for workloads that contain sensitive data and business IP. They offer a confidential computing environment, addressing your top security concerns for peace of mind when building applications in the cloud and helping you with the following issues:

- Memory protection through a trusted execution environment
- Data-at-rest and data-in-flight encryption
- Prevention of unauthorized access

You can provision Hyper protect Virtual Servers using IBM cloud catelog or using terraform script mentioned below:
[Terraform module to provision Hyper protect Virtual Servers](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/terraform-ibm-vpc-vsi)


## **Deploy application on Hyper Protect Virtual Server**

This Code Pattern is a node.js application that allows for the creation of keys, one for each "team" or "service. It uses that key to encrypt some customer data, ahead of being stored in the database. In this way, it demonstrates the above example, while showing how to use the Key Protect RESTful API provided by an instance of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services. IBM Cloud Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB is used as the database as it provides a standard MongoDB managed service, encrypted to anyone outside of the organisation with legitimate access to it. The application runs in a Docker container, for example on a Mac or Linux laptop, or following the directions below, on IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, for runtime protection in the public cloud.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

- Build and run a Docker container
- Get environment variables in a node.js app, from Docker
- Create an IBM Cloud IAM API key
- Drive the IBM Cloud Key Protect REST API, offered by IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services
