## **Overview**

Organizations are experiencing fragmented visibility; inconsistent user experiences; and significant complexity in application consumption, deployment and management. IBM Cloud Satellite gives you the ability to use IBM Cloud services anywhere — on IBM Cloud, on premises or at the edge — delivered as a service from a single pane of glass controlled through the public cloud.

## **Install**

Steps to set up your first location.

- Create a location.
- Add 6 hosts to the location that meet the minimum requirements.
- Assign the 6 hosts to the location control plane.
- Add more hosts to the location that meet the minimum requirements.
- Create a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster and assign the hosts to the cluster, so that you can run OpenShift workloads in your location.
