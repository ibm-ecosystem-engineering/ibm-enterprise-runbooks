### 2. Identify primary mentor for the journey

### 3.  Collect the data required for the sessions from the participants
[Participant Data Collection Sheet](Participant_Data_Sheet.xlsx)

### 4.  Github setup:

- Add all participants as members of the organization.

### 5. Slack Channel Setup
Set up a new slack channel (**SI-Name**-cloudnative) and add all participants

### 6. IBM Cloud Setup:
- Create resource group **sandbox-team-n..** under the SI Account to be used for the worksop

- Create access groups **SANDBOX-TEAM-N..-ADMIN** and **SANDBOX-TEAM-N..-USER** and make all users part of the SANDBOX-TEAM-ONE-USER group.

- Run these scripts to create access groups from iteration-zero repository
```bash
./acp-admin.sh SANDBOX-TEAM-ONE-ADMIN sandbox-team-one
./acp-user.sh SANDBOX-TEAM-ONE-USER sandbox-team-one us-east
```
- Board all users by adding them to access group SANDBOX-TEAM-N..-USER 

### 7. Cluster Setup:
- Setup a redhat openshift cluster (sandbox-ocp43-n..) in London datacenter with 3 worker nodes (16 cores x 32 GB)

### 8. Cloud-Native Toolkit Setup:
a) Install Cloud-Native toolkit onto the OCP Cluster (Follow instructions outlined in https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/installation-existing)

- [Install Tekton tasks](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/tree/master)
- [Artifactory Post Install Setup] (https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/artifactory-setup)
- [argocd Post Install Setup] (https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/argocd-setup)
- [Install Codeready workspaces] (https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/config-install#codeready-workspace-installation)

b) Customize dashboard to include crw, github links (replace links for your cluster)
```bash
igc tool-config --name sysdig --url https://us-east.monitoring.cloud.ibm.com/api/oauth/openid/IBM/0f42478cb66d4ce0b11c9168b02c5690/e0caebc1-92c0-46a5-b6d0-ef4ba28bd5ed

igc tool-config --name ir --url https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/registry/main/start
igc tool-config --name github --url https://github.com/ibm-workshop-team-one
igc tool-config --name codeready --url https://codeready-codeready.workshop-ocp43-one-3b1fc50af0b2002f0241bdf5d2432efd-0000.sjc03.containers.appdomain.cloud/dashboard/
```

c) Customize redhat openshit to include shortcuts to all tools

d) Finish the sysdig dashboard setip

### 10. Smoke test 
Test access control.
Add personal id to SANDBOX-ONE-USER access group.
Log into IBM Cloud as the personal id and run the following test cases:

- Check only the resources assigned to sandbox: 1 cluster and 2 services under sandbox-team-one resource group should be visible.
- Try creating a service. You should get an access denied error.
- Go to Billing->Usage: You should be able to view, but should not be able to change anything.
- Try creating a resource group/access group. It should get permission errors.
- Go to Classic Infrastructure. Should give access denied error.
- Reboot a worker node. Should not be a allowed operation.
- Check if sysdig instance created by Cloud-Native toolkit is collecting metrics from the resorces, and if it is not, set those up.
- Run pipelines of some starter kits and make sure they work.
- Check links from openshift and dashboard.

### 11.  Setup completed inventory solution with continous delivery (argocd)

### 12. Install CP4A on the openshift cluster
- Run schematics to install CP4A on openshift.
- Add Transformation Advisor (TA) link to the dashboard and openshift shortcut.
```bash
igc tool-config --name ta --url url-for-ta
```
- Add shortcut to TA from openshift.

### 13. Database setup for Application Modernization
- Create the Db2 Service from the IBM Cloud Catalogue.For Testing and demo purpose use Lite plan. For the workshop with developers hands-on, set it up with paid plan(Flex Plan).
![CreateDB2](/images/05SandBoxRunBook.png)
- Provide the name for the service as "PlantsDB" and create the service.  Please note the service is also provisioned in the same region as the Openshift cluster to avoid latency.
- Once you create the service, Navigate to the **'Service  Credential tab'** in the left Nav and create a new credential for the Db2 service. Capture the details as this would be needed for the application.
- Now Click 'Manage tab' and click **'Open Console'**  button.
- Click on the Run option in the top left nav, which should open the SQL Editor.
- Execute the DDL Scripts to create the Database for the Plants application (Refer PlantsDB-create.sql in the box folder).
- Execute the Insert scripts to populate data for the Plants application (Refer Populate-PlantsDB.sql in the box folder).
- Navigate to the **'connectioninfo'** tab and select the option 'without-sso'. Capture the Connection Details as well which is needed for the application
