## Installing Cloud Pak for Integration
The IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) is delivered as operators that are installed and managed using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) within Red Hat OpenShift. To install CP4I, you will verify that the OLM Catalog Sources for IBM components have been added, you will then install the operators using OLM, create the CP4I custom resources, and finally deploy some of the capabilities and runtimes.

**Note**: The versions for your installed operators, capabilities, and runtimes may not match what is shown in the screenshots below. This is the result of this CI/CD world we live in that we just have to adapt to.    

## OLM Catalog Sources

1. From your web browser use the Home icon to open the OpenShift console.

**Warning**: If you get a `PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR` error in the browser it is most likely indicative of an OpenShift certificate expiration issue. To fix the problem follow the steps in `Appendix A` below, wait a few minutes and then retry the above operation.

2. The login credentials should already be saved in the browser. If not use `ibmadmin` as Username and `engageibm` as Password (make sure to select the `htpasswd` authentication method).

3. From the left hand menu expand `Operators > OperatorHub` and search for `ibm cloud pak for integration` within the `Filter by keyword...` search bar. If the result is similar to the screenshot below skip Step 4 below and move to the next section.

4. (Optional) Click on the ![plus.png](images/plus.png) sign in the top right hand corner and paste the code from ![cs.yaml](code/cs.yaml) in the yaml editor and click `Create`. Repeat with ![cp.yaml](code/cp.yaml). Within a few minutes there should be two new pods in the `openshift-marketplace` project.

![operator-pods.png](images/operator-pods.png)

## Install the CP4I Operators and their dependencies

You can use the quick approach and install all of the CP4I operators at once by using the `IBM Cloud Pak for Integration` operator, or install them one by one by selecting only the capabilities and runtimes you want in your cluster. We will choose the latter approach in this lab.

1. If you are not within the `OperatorHub` menu of the OpenShift console follow the instructions in Step 3 from the previous section and search for `ibm common service` and click on its tile.
![cs-operator-tile.png](images/cs-operator-tile.png)

2. Read the description of the operator and click `Install`.
![cs-operator-install.png](images/cs-operator-install.png)

3. Accept all the defaults to install the operator at the cluster level. Click `Subscribe`.
![cs-operator-subscribe.png](images/cs-operator-subscribe.png)

The OLM will now go out and pull the operator and its dependencies (if any) from the online catalog and install them. When complete the result should look something like the following with `Succeeded` as status:
   
![cs-operator-installed.png](images/cs-operator-installed.png)

4. Repeat steps 1-3 above to install the following operators by searching for the corresponding name in the search bar:

- IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator
- IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Operations Dashboard
- IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Asset Repository
- IBM App Connect
- IBM MQ
- IBM API Connect (this will also install the pre-req IBM DataPower Gateway operator) 
- IBM Event Streams
- IBM Aspera HSTS

**Warning**: If the `IBM Operator for Redis` operator remains indefinitely in an `Installing` state you can simply ignore the message. This will only affect the deployment of the `Aspera` capability. However, if you really want to fix the problem refer to `Appendix B`. 

When complete the result should look something like the following with `Succeeded` as status across all namespaces:
   
![cp4i-operators-installed.png](images/cp4i-operators-installed.png)
   
## Create an instance of the Platform Navigator

We will deploy the Platform Navigator (PN) inside of a pre-configured namespace. We will use an online installation method to pull the necessary images from the `IBM Entitled Registry` using a pre-defined `entitlement key`.

1. From the OpenShift console, navigate to `Operators > Installed Operators`. Use the dropdown menu to select the `cp4i` project and select `IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator` from the list of installed operators.

![cp4i-pn-operator.png](images/cp4i-pn-operator.png)

2. From the `Details` tab click on `Create Instance`.

![cp4i-pn-create.png](images/cp4i-pn-create.png)
   
3. Verify that the namespace is `cp4i` and change the accept field to `true` within the yaml editor. Click `Create`

![cp4i-pn-yaml.png](images/cp4i-pn-yaml.png)
   
4. The deployment may take several minutes as the required images are downloaded from the image registry and any dependent services are deployed. If everything goes well the `Status` will change to `Ready`:

![cp4i-pn-ready.png](images/cp4i-pn-ready.png)
   
5. Once deployed, you can find the PN endpoint by clicking on its `Name` as shown below: 

![cp4i-pn-name.png](images/cp4i-pn-name.png)
   
6. To open the PN click on its URL under `Platform Navigator UI` and choose the `Default authentication` method:

![cp4i-pn-url.png](images/cp4i-pn-url.png)
   
7. The password for the `admin` user is stored in a secret called `platform-auth-idp-credentials` in the `ibm-common-services` namespace. To decode its value open a Terminal from the desktop and enter the following command:

```sh
   oc get secrets -n ibm-common-services platform-auth-idp-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_password}' | base64 --decode && echo ""
```

If you are prompted for a login and password after entering the above `oc` command use `ibmadmin` and `engageibm`.
   
8. Login to the Platform Navigator UI using `admin` as username and the password derived in Step 7 above. You are now ready to deploy some of the platform capabilities.
   
![cp4i-pn-ui.png](images/cp4i-pn-ui.png)
      
**Important**: Before you proceed to the next section make sure all pods in the `ibm-common-services` namespace are up and running as some of the capabilities and runtimes you will deploy below will depend on those services being operational.

## Deploy Platform Capabilities and Runtimes

You will now use the PN to deploy further integration capabilities. Capabilities provide tools for designing and managing integration instances like App Connect Dasboard, App Connect Designer, API Connect, Operations Dashboard or Asset Repository. Runtimes and instances are the runtime components of your integration solution like Aspera High speed transfer server, DataPower Gateway, Event Streams Kafka cluster or MQ Queue manager.

2. Navigate to `Workloads > Pods` and select `Project: openshift-operators` from the dropdown. Look for a pod that is crashing with an `OOMKilled` or `CrashLoopBackOff` error.

3. Look for the corresponding deployment under `Workloads > Deployments` and use the `Edit Deployment` option to modify it.

4. In the YAML editor scroll down to the `resources` section to update the `memory` requests and limits to `256Mi`. Click `Save`.

5. This will spawn a new pod and the operator installation will eventually change to `Succeeded`.
