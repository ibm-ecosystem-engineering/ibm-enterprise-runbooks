Learning tasks for developers to understand the concepts, technologies and methodologies for Cloud-Native development

</PageDescription>

Credits: This material heavily draws from [Cloud-Native bootcamp](https://cloudnative101.dev/)

Before you jump straight into Cloud-Native development using this crafted enablement journey, it's important you understand the related basic concepts, technologies used and methodologies applied for Cloud-Native development

Developer Foundation is broken into three areas:
