## Cloud Native Learning Journey

The foundation of any modern cloud solution is a **Cloud Native
** application. This core concept is formulated around a flexible platform
 and open programming models. These programming models enable a wide range of
  solutions to be constructed and delivered to users on top of an open
   platform. To enable developers and architects to realise the value of
    cloud native, IBM Cloud and Red Hat have delivered a world class cloud
     open platform to support enterprise software and **Cloud Native
     ** applications.

This learning journey has been designed to take developers through a step by
 step journey to build strong skills in both the programming models IBM is
  aligned towards and the underlying platform. This platform is Red Hat
   OpenShift, the multi/hybrid cloud kubernetes environment that provides developers extreme flexibility to build solutions for clients.

This Learning Journey is targeted at the following  [personas](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_personas/):
- **The Cloud Native Developer**
- **The DevSecOps Engineers**
- **The Ops and SRE's ([Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering))**

The learning journey is focused on using the **Partner Enterprise Sandbox**. The
 Sandbox provides full access to an IBM Cloud **Red Hat OpenShift Cloud
  Platform** development cluster which includes a set of CNCF open source
   software development lifecycle tools to demonstrate how to use IBM Cloud
    for full DevSecOps development.

The learning journey agenda is broken into **Foundation**, **Intermediate** and **Advanced** developer techniques and then extends with **Application Modernization** and **Application Integration**.

Select the **Cloud Native Journey** to select the style of how you want to
 use the **Partner Enterprise Sandbox**. You can use the self paced agenda or
  work with the Partner Ecosystem team to have a remote workshop model. The self
   paced model will enable longer term learning with the **Partner Enterprise
    Sandbox**

Before you jump straight into the Cloud Native learning journey, make sure
you have setup the necessary prerequisites, validated your Sandbox
environment and chosen the method you plan to use for you development tools.
